# Hallelujah

Hallelujah! This Angular module offers a [HAL/JSON](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html) http-client to easily interact with a [Spring Data Rest](https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest) API (and by extend any API that conforms the Spring Data Rest resource model)

!! This module needs Angular version 4.3+ since it uses the new HttpClientModule introduced in 4.3

Happy coding! Feedback much appreciated!
